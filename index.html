<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
Jigsaw Puzzle: Kudaketa Kakera (“the Game”) is developed by Sigkill Studios.

We do not maintain user accounts and do not run any servers.

<h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>

<h3>a) Google Play Games Services (Achievements & Login)</h3>

    <li>App interactions</li>
    <li>Diagnostics and crash information</li>

<h3>c) Google Play Billing</h3>
<p>
The Game uses Google Play Billing for the optional “Remove Ads” purchase.
All payment processing is handled entirely by Google Play.  
We do not receive or store any payment details, card information, or personal financial data.
The Game only receives a purchase confirmation token to enable the “Remove Ads” feature.
</p>

<h2>4. Support Contact</h2>
